# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? 
Remembering what I have previously learned and tying it all together. Just because I learned how to use a hammer today, doesn't mean everything is a nail.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I take notes during the live-sessions and when pre-reading lessons. But sometimes I member of my small group will have a good tip/idea I'll write down
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try solving on my own first. Almost to a fault. I love helping people and have no problem pausing what I'm working on to lend a hand but I have a hard asking for help myself. That's probably a whole can of worms but it is something that I have been activly working on and improving.
